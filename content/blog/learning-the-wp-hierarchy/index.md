Hey, my name is Tanner, I am 23 years old living near Salt lake City, Utah. Currently I am studying full time in hopes of entering the Web Design / Development Industry. I have many interests, and hobbies including fitness, fine art, yoga, and hiking is one of my greatest passions.

### Where The Blogging Began

I started to notice that I was writing things... well **Everywhere**! Whether it be sticky notes, note pads, ripped pieces of paper from _who knows where_, I was always writing my ideas down. This is the point in my life where I have decided to try and archive all my latest and greatest ***discoveries***, ***thoughts***,  ***goals***, ***inspirations*** and who knows what else!
